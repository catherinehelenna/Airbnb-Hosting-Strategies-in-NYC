### Background of the project

With the increasing number of accessible transportation modes for travelling, the demand of accommodation is also rising since the last decade. Thanks to this phenomenon, one of the well-known accommodation provider service companies, Airbnb,is gaining more hosts as well as guests. Airbnb would like to expand its reach on potential locations in New York City so the company is interested to find out what kind of room type is currently popular in terms of annual availability and ownership.<br>

As a data analyst working in Airbnb, you need to figure out how to obtain those information from a provided Airbnb dataset in New York City in 2019. By finding those information, you can give insight to the company about the next hosting strategies to fulfill the demand better. You are expected to complete the study in a month to show your findings on the next meeting.

### Problem Statement

Investigate the popularity of Airbnb room types in New York City, specifically those with an availability of less than 120 days. Analyze room types, neighborhood variances, and pricing influences on the minimum booking duration for guests, with the goal of completing the study within a month.

### What can you find in this project?

Data cleaning, visualizations, and statistical studies to give insights for the next hosting strategies.

### Finally, the recommendation for the hosting strategies!

Setting up more listings on Staten Island for 'Shared room' can fulfill the observed demand, leading to potential higher prices. Here are the consideration points:

- The geospatial heatmap distribution of popular Airbnb rooms suggests that Staten Island has less Airbnb listing density compared to Manhattan and Brooklyn although its 'Shared room' is most on demand.

- The pie chart points out how low 'Shared room' proportion is compared to other room types in the neighbourhoods. So, the competition for booking is also less.

- It is possible to set up high price on the listing since the guests tend to stay in longer periods for more expensive Airbnb rooms.
